This project will hold all my Arduino-Code

Currently included here:

* Hausmessung
Contains code to meassure power consumption of our house by an Arduino and to send these data
via radio to a central arduino node, where it is stored on a NAS.
Code for temperature meassurement with DS18B20 sensors will follow
Currently, the water temperature of the Axolotl water is meassured and a fan is used to cool the water.

* more coming soon...
